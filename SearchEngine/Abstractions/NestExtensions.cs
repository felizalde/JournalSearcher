Universal access refers to the conscious and systematic effort to proactively apply principles, methods and tools of universal design order to develop Information Society Technologies that are accessible and usable by all citizens, including the very young and the elderly and people with different types of disabilities, thus avoiding the need for a posteriori adaptations or specialized design. The journal's unique focus is on theoretical, methodological, and empirical research, of both technological and non-technological nature, that addresses equitable access and active participation of potentially all citizens in the information society. The journal´s perspective is that the requirement for universal access stems from the growing impact of the fusion of the emerging technologies, and from the different dimensions of diversity, which are intrinsic to the information society. These dimensions become evident when considering the broad range of user characteristics, the changing nature of human activities, the variety of contexts of use, the increasing availability and diversification of information and knowledge sources and services, the proliferation of technological platforms, etc. The Journal's primary objectives are to: provide an archival publication channel for the discussion and advancement of theoretical and practical aspects of universal access in the information society facilitate the rapid and wide diffusion of scientific and technological results that promote universal access in the information society stimulate cross-fertilization between the different contributing disciplines. The journal publishes research work on the design, development, evaluation, use, and impact of Information Society Technologies, and as on standardization, policy, and other non-technological issues that facilitate and promote universal access. Paper submissions, in English, should report on theories, methods, tools, empirical results, reviews, case studies, and best-practice examples, in any application domain, and should have a clear focus on universal access.

For all members of the AI community the journal provides quick access to current topics in the field and promotes vital interdisciplinary interchange. \nPreview: \nIntentional Forgetting \nCurrent trends, like the digital transformation and ubiquitous computing, yield in a massive increase in available data and information. On the other hand, in Artificial Intelligence systems, capacity of knowledge bases is limited due to computational complexity of many inference algorithms. Consequently, continuously sampling information and unfiltered storing in knowledge bases does not seem to be a promising or even feasible strategy. In human evolution, learning and forgetting have evolved as advantageous strategies for coping with available information by adding new knowledge to and removing irrelevant information from the human memory. Learning has been adopted in AI systems in various algorithms and applications. Forgetting, however, especially intentional forgetting,\nhas gained much less attention, despite the potential forgetting can provide for coping with the seemingly ever increasing information overload observed in current systems. \nThe aim of this special issue is to provide an overview on available theories and methods as well as ongoing research on forgetting and intentional forgetting relevant for the theory and practice of AI and AI systems from different perspectives like, e.g., knowledge representation, cognition, ontologies, reasoning, machine learning, self-organization, distributed AI, etc. \nSmart Production \nSmart Production is key for industrial and societal growth, providing opportunities for designing our future work life. This special issue targets to illustrate the requirements and challenges of a smart production which targets not only cyber-physical systems as enabler technology and AI-based robots in production but also solutions for supporting humans in production. For a beneficial use of AI, the necessary infrastructure must be provided. This includes currently used communication protocols and proposed architectures, as well as production systems. Also, contributions concerning the role of AI in context of robots and human workers, respectively, and industrial use-cases are invited.\nArtificial Intelligence in Games\nThe special issue focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied in and for different types of games (e.g., board games, video games, serious games). Games have been shown to be the perfect testbed for advanced AI methods. AI in games is now a well established research area with two dedicated conferences and as well as a dedicated journal. Especially deep learning methods have recently proven to beat the best human experts in Atari video games and the game Go. Other methods such as evolutionary computation have been shown to allow complete new types of games through procedural content generation. While there has been much progress in game AI recently, some games such as StarCraft remain beyond even the most advanced AI algorithms. The goal of this special issue is to present a survey of the current research in Game AI and emerging trends in this area.",

The basic idea behind these systems is that by enriching an environment with technology (sensors, processors, actuators, information terminals, and other devices interconnected through a network), a system can be built such that based on the real-time information gathered and the historical data accumulated, decisions can be taken to benefit the users of that environment. Expected benefits of this technology can be: (a) increasing safety (e.g., by monitoring lifestyle patterns or the latest activities and providing assistance when a possibly harmful situation is developing), (b) comfort (e.g., by adjusting temperature automatically), and (c) economy (e.g., controlling the use of lights).The Journal on Reliable Intelligent Environments focuses on theoretical developments and lessons learnt on the deployment of IEs.  The broad areas represented in the journal reflect the fact that reliability of software systems is the result of a number of approaches combined so an overarching principle of our publication will be to be open and flexible to embrace all type of techniques which can increase confidence in Intelligent Environments systems:selection, installation and calibration of equipmentdeployment and maintenance problemsrequirementsmodelingsimulationtestingvalidationformal verificationpeople-centred computingtoolspilots designsoftware development processsecurityprivacyusabilitysafetyperformancequality of servicelarge-scale integrationscalabilityadaptiveness and autonomicity",

Such systems involve constraints placed not only on their size, cost, and power consumption, but also on the timeliness of the image data processed. Examples of such systems are mobile phones, digital still/video/cell-phone cameras, portable media players, personal digital assistants, high-definition television, video surveillance systems, industrial visual inspection systems, medical imaging devices, vision-guided autonomous robots, spectral imaging systems, and many other real-time embedded systems. In these real-time systems, strict timing requirements demand that results are available within a certain interval of time as imposed by the application. It is often the case that an image processing algorithm is developed and proven theoretically sound, presumably with a specific application in mind, but its practical applications and the detailed steps, methodology, and trade-off analysis required to achieve its real-time performance are not fully explored, leaving these critical and usually non-trivial issues for those wishing to employ the algorithm in a real-time system. The Journal of Real-Time Image Processing is intended to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of image processing, serving the greater community of researchers, practicing engineers, and industrial professionals who deal with designing, implementing or utilizing image processing systems which must satisfy real-time design constraints. The journal solicits original contributions in the following areas: - Real-time image and video processing algorithms - Real-time embedded image/video processing systems - Real-time image and video processing hardware and architecture including FPGA, DSP, GPU, GPP, ASIC, System-on-Chip (SoC), and System-in-a-Package (SiP) implementations - Real-time software optimizations and related design paradigms for image/video processing - Real-time hardware/software co-design for image and video processing - Real-time image and video processing applications including digital, cell-phone, and smart cameras, machine vision, industrial inspection, surveillance and security, image and video compression for transmission and for database storage and retrieval, biomedical imaging, spectral imaging, etc. Manuscripts that do not address real-time (algorithmic, hardware, software or implementation) issues do not fall within the theme of JRTIP and are encouraged to be submitted to the Springer Journal of Signal, Image and Video Processing (SIViP) for publication consideration.",

                AimsAndScope = "The field of computer virus prevention has rapidly taken an important position in our technological and information society. Viral attacks increase year after year, and antiviral efforts continually face new challenges. Beneficial applications of technologies based on scientific computer virology are still very limited. The theoretical aspects of the virus problem are only rarely considered, although many interesting and important open problems still exist. Little proactive research is focused on predicting the future of viral attacks.The Journal of Computer Virology and Hacking Techniques is an independent scientific and technical journal dedicated to viral and antiviral computer technologies. Both theoretical and experimental aspects will be considered; papers emphasizing the theoretical aspects are especially welcome. The topics covered by this journal include, but are certainly not limited to:- Mathematical aspects and theoretical fundamentals of computer virology- Algorithmics and computer virology- Computer immunology and biological models for computers- Reverse engineering (hardware and software)- Viral  and antiviral technologies- Cryptology and steganography tools and techniques- Applications in computer virology- Virology and IDS- Hardware hacking, and free and open hardware- Operating system, network, and embedded systems security- Social engineeringIn addition, since computational problems are of practical interest, papers on the computational aspects of computer virology are welcome. It is expected that the areas covered by this journal will change as new technologies, methodologies, challenges and applications develop. Hacking involves understanding technology intimately and in depth in order to use it in an operational way. Hackers are complementary to academics in that they favour the result over the methods and over the theory, while academics favour the formalization and the methods -- explaining is not operating and operating is not explaining. The aim of the journal in this respect is to build a bridge between the two communities for the benefit of technology and science.The aim of the Journal of Computer Virology and Hacking Techniques is to promote constructive research in computer virology by publishing technical and scientific results related to this research area. Submitted papers will be judged primarily by their content, their originality and their technical and scientific quality. Contributions should comprise novel and previously unpublished material.However, prior publication in conference proceedings of an abstract, summary, or other abbreviated, preliminary form of the material should not preclude publication in this journal when notice of such prior or concurrent publication is given with the submission. In addition to full-length theoretical and technical articles, short communications or notes are acceptable. Survey papers will be accepted with a prior invitation only. Special issues devoted to a single topic are also planned.The policy of the journal is to maintain strict refereeing procedures, to perform a high quality peer-review of each submitted paper, and to send notification to the author(s) with as short a delay as possible. Accepted papers will normally be published within one year of submission at the latest. The journal will be published four times a year.Note: As far as new viral techniques are concerned, the journal strongly encourages authors to consider algorithmic aspects rather than the actual source code of a particular virus. Nonetheless, papers containing viral source codes may be accepted provided that a scientific approach is maintained and that inclusion of the source code is necessary for the presentation of the research. No paper containing a viral source code will be considered or accepted unless the complete source code is communicated to the Editor-in-Chief. No publication will occur before antiviral companies receive this source code to update/upgrade their products.The final objective is, once again, proactive defence.This journal was previously known as Journal in Computer Virology.

It offers, above all, a tool-oriented link between academic research and industrial practice.Tool support for the development of reliable and correct computer-based systems is of growing importance, and a wealth of design methodologies, algorithms, and associated tools have been developed in different areas of computer science. However, each area has its own culture and terminology, preventing researchers from taking advantage of the results obtained by colleagues in other fields. Tool builders are often unaware of the work done by others, and thus unable to apply it. The situation is even more critical when considering the transfer of new technology into industrial practice.STTT addresses this situation by publishing accessible papers that introduce researchers and practitioners to state-of-the-art tools and techniques.STTT focuses on three major technical themes:1. Construction and analysis issues: These involve hierarchical and compositional approaches; syntax-oriented vs. semantic methods; synthesis vs. verification; formal support of the entire system life cycle, including requirements capture, design, implementation, verification, testing maintenance, evolution; and analysis of non-functional aspects of system behavior, such as real-time, probability, and efficiency.2. Practicality issues: These address performance, genericity, and usability of tools; case studies and experience reports; and industrial use and feedback.3. Generic tool issues: These include paradigms (fully automated vs. interactive approaches); design issues (modularity, efficiency, portability, integrability, reusability); automatic support (tool generators, integrators, and interface builders); and user interfaces (graphics, Web forms, retrieval).STTT comprises Regular Papers, Special Sections in the form of Special Issues or Thematic Sections, as well as an Opinion Corner with Position Papers and Reviews.Due to STTT's emphasis on technology transfer, we encourage an illustrative, example-driven presentation style that focuses on the underlying themes. Technical material and detailed proofs that are not necessary for the comprehension of the essence and the impact of the contributions should be replaced by adequate referencing of other publications or be provided separately in an online appendix. This way the journal provides a fast and intuitive entry into new material and new themes, and, at the same time, the online appendix gives experts easy access to the related technical or theoretical details.

This (r)evolution accompanying the paradigm shift from reductionism to complex systems sciences has already largely transformed the natural sciences and is about to bring the same changes to the techno-socio-economic sciences, viewed broadly.EPJ Data Science offers a publication platform to address this evolution by bringing together all academic disciplines concerned with the same challenges:how to extract meaningful data from systems with ever increasing complexityhow to analyse them in a way that allows new insightshow to generate data that is needed but not yet availablehow to find new empirical laws, or more fundamental theories, concerning how any natural or artificial (complex) systems workThis is accomplished through experiments and simulations, by data mining or by enriching data in a novel way. The focus of this journal is on conceptually new scientific methods for analyzing and synthesizing massive data sets, and on fresh ideas to link these insights to theory building and corresponding computer simulations. As such, articles mainly applying classical statistics tools to data sets or with a focus on programming and related software issues are outside the scope of this journal.EPJ Data Science covers a broad range of research areas and applications and particularly encourages contributions from techno-socio-economic systems, where it comprises those research lines that now regard the digital “tracks” of human beings as first-order objects for scientific investigation. Topics include, but are not limited to, human behavior, social interaction (including animal societies), economic and financial systems, management and business networks, socio-technical infrastructure, health and environmental systems, the science of science, as well as general risk and crisis scenario forecasting up to and including policy advice.",

This stems from the observation that higher software quality and productivity is more likely to be achieved if well-understood, tested practices and technologies are introduced in software development. Reported empirical studies usually involve the collection and analysis of data and experience that can be used to characterize, evaluate and reveal relationships between software development deliverables, practices, and technologies. Over time, it is expected that such empirical results will form a body of knowledge leading to widely accepted and well-formed theories. Empirical Software Engineering aims at promoting the publication of industry-relevant research since one of its goals is to address the significant gap between research and practice. Research ArticlesBoth original and replicated studies can be reported, varying from controlled experiments to field studies, from data intensive to qualitative. Preference is given to studies that can be replicated or expanded upon. Papers on the infrastructure for supporting empirical research are also of interest.Specific topics relevant to the journal include the following: Analysis and design Model-driven development Requirements engineering Verification and validationMaintenance and evolutionQuality assuranceDependability analysis Project managementOrganization models for software developmentPredictive models for software dependabilitySoftware engineering economics Applications of artificial intelligence techniques to software engineering Qualitative analysis  Industrial Experience ReportsThe Empirical Software Engineering journal also seeks the submission of industrial experience reports. Their goal is to report results regarding the application of software technologies (such as processes, methods, or tools) and their effectiveness in industrial settings. This interest stems from the increasing realization that the journal needs to provide insights resulting from the industrial experience of software development to the software engineering community at large. These experience reports would not only be useful for researchers to identify relevant research questions, but they would also be useful for software development organizations to share relevant information. An industrial experience report would be expected to address the following items at a minimum: Describe the context from which results are reported: organization, problem domain, projects, products, processesDescribe the software technologies (such as processes, methods, or tools) that are assessed and why they are importantProvide effectiveness and efficiency data leading to the assessment of the technologiesInterpret the results, explain their consequences, and draw conclusionsDiscuss the limitations of the results and conclusionsIndustrial experience reports may be as concise as an author wishes, provided that they cover the above items. They will be clearly labeled as industrial experience reports to indicate that different criteria are used to review them.

Examples of DEDSs include manufacturing plants, communication networks, computer systems, management information databases, logistics systems, command-control-communication systems, robotics, and other man-made operational systems. The state processes of such systems cannot be described by differential equations in general. The aim of this journal, Discrete Event Dynamic Systems: Theory and Applications, is to publish high-quality, peer-reviewed papers on the modeling and control of, and all other aspects related to, DEDSs. In particular, the journal publishes papers dealing with general theories and methodologies of DEDSs and their applications to any particular subject, including hybrid systems, as well as papers discussing practical problems from which some generally applicable DEDS theories or methodologies can be formulated; The scope of this journal is defined by its emphasis on discrete events and the dynamic nature of the systems and on their modeling, control and optimization. Motivation. The Journal welcomes papers describing modeling and control problems with discrete events from all areas of engineering and sciences. The development of the theory of DEDS must continuously be motivated by concrete problems. The term \"problem\" is interpreted here in a broad sense to include not only problems from the real world but also well-defined problems arising from the methodological context. As a scientific and engineering discipline, DEDS must have both experimental and theoretical components. Carefully designed experiments accumulate evidence upon which a relevant theory can be built. Conversely, analytical and mathematical reasoning pinpoint further experiments to be conducted for theory validation and extension. The Journal shall encourage papers emphasizing this interplay between modeling, experimentation, and mathematical theory. It is not devoted exclusively to the mathematics of DEDS. The Journal aims at providing a science and engineering knowledge base for the studies of DEDS. Dynamics of Discrete Event Systems. Recognition of the role of \"dynamics\" in DEDSs seems crucial for the eventual development of a fruitful theory. While the analysis of DEDS may proceed via many fronts, such as graph theory, queueing theory, simulation, automata, Petri nets, etc., concepts from system theory are expected to play a central role. Control and Optimization. Most real-world DEDS are \"man-made\" to serve specific purposes, and, thus, they require control and/or management. Theoretical concepts, such as feedback, stability, and optimality, as well as implementation issues, such as software and languages, will all receive attention. Interface with Operations Research and Computer Science. It is expected that the future developments of DEDS will continue to involve and be impacted by developments in OR and CS. This journal also welcomes papers dealing with issues at these intersections. The journal welcomes submissions on all aspects of DEDS, including but not restricted to: theory and formal models (supervisory control, Petri-Nets, Min-Max-plus algebra, DEDS specification, or simulation formalisms), performance analysis, optimization, and optimal control (perturbation analysis, control synthesis, sample-path-based approaches, AI-based learning schemes, scalable solutions to large and complex systems), and applications (case studies and software engineering).  ",

This research aims to increase the speed and capacity of digital communication and strengthen security by improving the encryption necessary to combat cryptanalytic attacks. With improved encryption, communication will become more secure from the cryptanalytic attacks that threaten the confidentiality and integrity of personal data stored on and transmitted by mobile devices. Increasing the speed, reliability, and capacity of wireless communication is essential for growth, since the radio spectrum is a bounded resource. While sometimes treated as separate entities with distinct research goals, communication and cryptography often use similar models and techniques and work in tandem in digital networks. As a result, this journal’s distinctive combination encourages researchers to strive for advancements that will improve both areas simultaneously, thus providing a publishing forum for these domains, covering all the fundamental and computational aspects of these research fields.

Thus, the journal is aimed at the growing trend in robotics toward mobility, intelligence and autonomy in an unstructured world. This trend has been made possible by small, inexpensive, high-performance computers. The term `robot' implies that the systems described here are capable of performing purposeful behaviors in the real world. They obtain inputs from the world through sensors and act upon the world through actuators. The connection between sensing and actuation may be simple signal processing or it may involve complex decision making, goal interpretation and other aspects of reasoning. Most autonomous systems display some form of mobility: on land, under water, in the air or in space. The mobility may make use of wheels, legs, fins, rotors or other actuators. The focus is on the ability to move and be self-sufficient, not on whether the system is an imitation of biology. Of course, biological models for robotic systems are of major interest to the journal since living systems are prototypes for autonomous behavior.Autonomous robots must be able to perform in the world. Hence, publication preference will be given to papers which include performance data on actual robots in the real world. Papers which include only simulation results will be considered for publication, but with a lower priority.

The increasing complexity and scope of computer applications makes the design of efficient algorithms essential. Algorithmica is an international journal which publishes original papers on algorithms that are either (i) theoretical papers addressing problems arising in practical areas or (ii) experimental papers that have general appeal because of their practical importance or techniques. Papers are expected to make significant contributions, judged in terms of theoretical analysis, simulations, or algorithm behavior on data from applications. The areas listed below are representative areas; papers in other areas are certainly welcome. The fields of interest include algorithms in applied areas such as: VLSI, distributed computing, parallel processing, automated design, robotics, graphics, data base design, software tools, as well as algorithms in fundamental areas such as sorting, searching, data structures, computational geometry, and linear programming. It is expected that the areas covered by this journal will change as new technologies, methodologies and applications develop. In addition to these regular papers, the journal features two special sections: Application Experience and Problems. The objective of the Application Experience section is to publish findings obtained from applications of theoretical results to practical situations. Findings include, but are not limited to, difficulties encountered in the course of the implementation or testing of algorithms (e.g., handling of degenerate cases which are often not addressed in detail but which actually occur in practice), nontrivial deviations of actual running times of the implemented algorithms from the asymptotic analytical studies, comparisons of actual performance of various algorithms proposed, and discussions of applicability of theoretical studies in practice. All submissions will be subject to the reviewing process and copies of source codes should be made available upon request by the Editor for reviewing purposes. The Problems section publishes short papers presenting problems on selected topics of computer science. Special emphasis will be given to papers surveying open problems in a specific area of interest. Contributions will begin with a title and an introductory statement identifying a theme of research, followed by a list of related problems which to the author's knowledge are as yet unsolved. Authors are encouraged to annotate the text with comments, background material and appropriate references. All submissions will be subject to the reviewing process. Special issues devoted to a single topic are also planned.",
